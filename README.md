# hain-plugin-putty
A Hain plugin to launch PuTTY sessions. Currently extremely simplistic.

Support querying stored PuTTY sessions and running any putty command

## Requirements
Current it expects to find the `putty` command to be in your PATH.

## TODO
1. Check for Putty in normal locations if not in PATH.
2. Tests, code format preferences and all that stuff!
